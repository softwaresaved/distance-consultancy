To develop Distance you need to have a working knowledge of the following:

* Distance for Windows. See, for example, Distance 6.2 Release 1 User's Guide.
* Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 programming
* Microsoft Data Access Objects (DAO)
* Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) i.e. ActiveX, etc.
* Fortran programming
  - Primarily Fortran 77 but some Fortran 90
* R scripting
  - For an introduction, see [A (very) short introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf)
* Geographic coordinate systems and projections. 
  - See "Appendix B: Geographic Coordinates Systems & Map Projections" ([PDF](http://distancesampling.org/downloads/appendixbprojections.pdf)) from Strindberg, S. (2001) Optimized Automated Survey Design in Wildlife Population  Assessment. Unpublished PhD Thesis. University of St. Andrews.
* ESRI Shapefiles:
  - See ESRI Shapefile Technical Description ([PDF](http://distancesampling.org/downloads/shapefile.pdf)), a white paper produced by ESRI describing the internal format of a shapefile
  - You may also find  Martin Wegmann's Spatial data handling in R cheatsheet ([PDF](https://github.com/wegmann/RSdocs/blob/master/Cheatsheet/AniMove_refcard.pdf?raw=true)) useful.
* Using revision control
  - Git - for an introduction, see [Version Control with Git](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/index.html)
  - CVS - for an introduction, see [Open Source Development with CVS](http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/)
  - See also [Version Control by Example](http://ericsink.com/vcbe/)
